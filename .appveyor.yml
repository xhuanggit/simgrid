# Strawberry perl is the one to work with gcc; AppVeyor provides ActiveState perl, which is the one to work with visual.
# This package is so outdated and broken that we cannot use it anymore. So we build without perl

# - SET PATH=C:\strawberry\c\bin;C:\strawberry\perl\site\bin;C:\strawberry\perl\bin;%PATH%
# Lua

# We need python v3
- cmd: SET PATH=C:\Python37-x64;%PATH% # We need python v3
# Ugly hack to ignore versions 3.8 and later of Python
- rename "C:\Python38-x64\python.exe" "python-ignored.exe"
- rename "C:\Python39-x64\python.exe" "python-ignored.exe"
# Use the mingw-w64 provided by Appveyor (must be placed before Perl in the path)

# Work around a bug on appveyor where the default sh is not the one I expect
