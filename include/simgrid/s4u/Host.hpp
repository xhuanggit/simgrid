   *      computing speed you would get at another pstate)
   *    - If you declared an external load (with @ref simgrid::surf::Cpu::set_speed_profile()), you must multiply the

   *
   *  The remaining speed is then shared between the executions located on this host.
   *  You can retrieve the amount of tasks currently running on this host with @ref get_load().
   *
   *  The host may have multiple cores, and your executions may be able to use more than a single core.
   *
   *  Finally, executions of priority 2 get twice the amount of flops than executions of priority 1.
