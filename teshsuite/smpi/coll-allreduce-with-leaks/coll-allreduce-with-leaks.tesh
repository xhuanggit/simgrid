> [0.023780] [smpi_utils/INFO] coll-allreduce-with-leaks.c:28: leaked allocations of total size 1504, called 16 times, with minimum size 64 and maximum size 124
> [0.023780] [smpi_utils/INFO] coll-allreduce-with-leaks.c:27: leaked allocations of total size 1024, called 16 times, each with size 64
> [0.023780] [smpi_utils/INFO] Memory Usage: Simulated application allocated 2528 bytes during its lifetime through malloc/calloc calls.
> Largest allocation at once from a single process was 124 bytes, at coll-allreduce-with-leaks.c:28. It was called 1 times during the whole simulation.
> If this is too much, consider sharing allocations for computation buffers.
> This can be done automatically by setting --cfg=smpi/auto-shared-malloc-thresh to the minimum size wanted size (this can alter execution if data content is necessary)
